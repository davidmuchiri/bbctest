Instructions
You have been given some data by the editorial department in the ./src/data directory.

They need you to build an interactive project where users will select an Indian city and have their local air quality displayed in cigarettes and particulate matter.

How the users select their city is up to you: editorial have used dropdowns, buttons, maps, and keyword entry autocomplete text fields before. It's your choice.

Techincal requirements
The task must be served as all flat files so that the solution can scale in a serverless environment - e.g. HTML, CSS, and JS in S3

The task could use node, npm, webpack, babel etc to compile/transpile into the end project files for deployment. Whatever environment you are comfortable with, but no jquery, please.

The project is going to go live in areas that do not have good broadband access, so please pay attention to file size and performance.

Some users may have older phones, so please ensure your code works on IE11 and up.

Project requirements
Must have:

Ability for users to choose a country and see air quality in the form of cigarettes and particulate matter (PM2.5)
all text fields from the data json file displaying in a logical manner
All production files outputted into a ./dist folder ready for making live.
Nice to have:

A version in hindi (data also supplied in separate JSON file)
Test cases for your code.
What we're looking for
We're looking for a logical approach to the work, some creativity, beautiful code and a nice output.

Don't spend too long on it. 4-8 hours should be enough.

Please send your code together with a Readme file explaining how to install/run the project and any other notes as a Zip file or a GitHub repository. Please also confirm that we have received the test (it may get blocked by spam filters).
